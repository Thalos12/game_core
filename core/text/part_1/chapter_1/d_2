[Village X, central square]
Villager 1: Ah, tonight is the night of the Blessed Children.
Villager 2: Unfortunately its only for couples without children, else i would have gone with my wife.
Old villager: Haven't you got already five children?
Villager 2: Sure, but they are never enough.
Villager 1: I believe that your wife doesn't share this idea!
The three laugh, then greet the two people that are walking towards them.
Villager 2: Yalon! Iset! Are you ready for tonight?
Iset: Sure, the horses are ready. We will depart after lunch.
Villager 1: Are you nervous Iset? I see your hands are trembling.
Iset: Oh, yes, sorry.
Villager 1: Do not be sorry, it is a normal reaction. What about you Yalon?
Yalon: I am nervous, a lot.
Old villager: It doesn't look like you are.
Iset: Believe me, he may be more nervous than me. This morning, while we were eating breakfast he spilled the milk and
broke a bowl.
They all laughed.
Old villager: Remember to hold always hold your hands! It is said that a couple fit gets the right to have a Blessed
Child only if their bond is strong enough.
Yalon: We know, we already went to the priest to know how the ritual works.
