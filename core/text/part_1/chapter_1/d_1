[Goddess Palace, inner room]
In her room, the Goddess is ready to give birth to her children. The handmaids are frantically moving between her and
the holy spring to cool her body.
Handmaid 1: The Goddess is almost ready.
Handmaid 2: How many this time?
Handmaid 1: At least five thousand.
Handmaid 2: Somewhat a higher number compared to two hundred years ago.
Handmaid 3: This means it will be harder for each of them to prevail.
Handmaid 1: Many will die before reaching the Sacred Terrace.
Handmaid 2: True, they are naturally attracted to each other and they eventually fight to the death. It is their nature.
Handmaid 3: Only one will become a god.
Handmaid 2: Only one will ascend.
Handmaid 1: Only one will survive.
After a few seconds of complete silence, the Goddess groans, then emits a low lament and finally shouts. Her body slowly
starts to glow, a light blue colored light floods the room. The Goddess shivers, and the light concentrates up above her
body, in a small, pulsating marble of light. It starts to move toward the window on the roof of the room, which was
previously opened. As it moves upwards it gets bigger and bigger. When it gets out it is almost as big as a person. This
shining globe of light finally stops and starts burning, getting brighter and brighter. From blue it slowly becomes red.
It expands and finally explode into a bright red flash.
Goddess: Children... Make me proud of you...
The Goddess faints, while tears draw lines on her face.
