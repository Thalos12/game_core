# GAME_CORE

This project has as main aim to build the core of a simple, textual, rpg-like game.

# How to

After downloading with git, navigate to the directory through the terminal then type “python main.py” without quotes.
There is no tutorial: for now you can just create a profile.

# Name of the profile

At this point the game will consider upper case letters as different from lower case letter.
Profiles named pippo, Pippo, PIPPO, PiPpO, etc… can all play on the same machine as different players.

# Saving

At the moment saving is allowed only at the moment a new profile is created. This is intentional also because there is no way, for now, to modify it (e.g. level up, change equipment, etc…).
After downloading with git, navigate to the directory through the terminal then type “python main.py” without quotes.
There is no tutorial: for now you can only create a profile.

# Playing

After downloading with git, navigate to the directory through the terminal then type “python main.py”, without quotes.
There is no tutorial: for now you can create a profile and view it. Read the in game main menu instructions to learn how to display the stats.

# The profile

Your profile has three main aspects for now:
<ul>
<li>character stats
<li>weapon stats
<li>armor stats
</ul>
More features will be available in the future, such as a skill.

# New updates

There will be many changes in the code, especially in the beginning.
Expect your profiles to be deleted in case of changes to the player class.
