# About this project

This project has as main aim to build the core of a simple rpg-like game.

# How to get and run game_core

Download with git (using <code>git clone https://github.com/Thalos12/game_core</code>), navigate to the directory through the terminal then type <code>python main.py</code>.
There is no tutorial at the moment: you can only create a profile (soon we will add a complete battle experience against bots).

# Choosing a name for the profile

The game will consider upper case letters as different from lower case letter.
Profiles named pippo, Pippo, PIPPO, PiPpO, etc… can all be assigned to different players.

# Explanation of the profile

Your profile has three main aspects for now:
<ul>
<li>character stats
<li>weapon stats
<li>armor stats
</ul>
More features will be available in the future, such as skills.

# Saving

At the moment saving is allowed only at the moment a new profile is created. This is intentional also because there is no way, for now, to modify it (e.g. level up, change equipment, etc…).

# New updates

There will be many changes in the code, especially in the beginning.
Expect your profiles to be deleted in case of changes to the player class.
