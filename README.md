# GAME_CORE

This project has as main aim to build the core of a simple, textual, rpg-like game.

# How to

After downloading with git, navigate to the directory through the terminal then type “python main.py”, without quotes.
There is no tutorial: for now you can just create a profile and view it. Read the in game main menu instructions to learn how to display the stats.

# The profile

Your profile has three main aspects for now:
<ul>
<li>character stats
<li>weapon stats
<li>armor stats
</ul>
More features will be available in the future.
